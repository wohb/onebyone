# onebyone
In-memory message queue that can hold one message at a time

## Description
Distributed architectures often have message queues that fill up and stress the nodes on which the queue is running, and the onebyone message queue solves exactly that problem.  
Reduce your system complexity by queueing just one message at a time.
